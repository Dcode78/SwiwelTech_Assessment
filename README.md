# SwiwelTech_Assessment - Assignment code

## Challanges ##
1. Individual product display page was behaving inconsistant when only two filters (4 stars an up reviews and english language) were applied. 
    Some products had book formats such as "Hard back", "Kindle only" this was an obstacle when getting the unit price.
    
    Work around - Applied an extra layer of filtering "Paperback" so the results received were consistant
